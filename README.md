# TODO:
## Add new word "key" at top/bottom of the suggestions bar on left side of screen
## When in add new word mode, suggestions become the letters for each key
## Need to be able to switch key bindings for when in letter or symbol mode
## Hitting '1' key should present symbol's keyboard
## Detection of when a word ends by selection of suggestion or select first suggestion if punctuation or space hit
## Key bindings should change if caps lock is on
